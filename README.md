# 🚀 DeployStack Template Repository

> The open repository of Infrastructure as Code templates generated by [DeployStack.io](https://deploystack.io)

## 🎯 What's This?

This repository contains automatically generated Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates for various applications, making it easy to deploy them to different cloud providers. Each sub-directory represents a different application with its specific deployment configurations.

## 📚 Browse Templates

You can explore all available application templates in two ways:
- 🌐 Visit our [Template Catalog](https://deploystack.io/c) for a user-friendly interface
- 📂 Browse through this repository's directories

## ⚡ How It Works

1. **Source**: Each template starts from a `docker-compose.yml` file or `docker run` command in/from a public repository or submit to DeployStack
2. **Generation**: Our [docker-to-iac](https://github.com/deploystackio/docker-to-iac) module transforms it into cloud-specific templates
3. **Deployment**: Use our one-click deploy buttons to launch on your preferred cloud provider

## 🏗️ Supported Cloud Providers

Please visit our docs at: [https://docs.deploystack.io/docker-to-iac/parser](https://docs.deploystack.io/docker-to-iac/parser)
